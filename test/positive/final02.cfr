// Test for final (immutable) constraint

a
 b ?
  c ?
  d ?
  final e ?
   


// Rao: 20140811: Even though this code does not failed to parse, it is not working as expected.
// This should desugars to 
/*
a {
  b ? {
    c ? d ? e ? {
      [final]
    }
    }
  }



But it desugars to the followiing, which is wrong

a {
  b ? {
    c ? d ? final e ? 
  }
  }
