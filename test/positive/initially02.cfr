// Test for initially constraint

a
 b ?
  initial c ?
  d ?
  e ?

/*
 Rao 2014-08-08: Ofcourse it parses perfectly with initial c ?
 But if I cahnge (initial c)  to  (initiaaal c), then also it parses correctly
 which need to be checked with Paulius.
 Here is the output.
[Linearized tree]

a {
  b ? {
    initiaaal c ? d ? e ? 
  }
  }
*/

/*
Rao: 20140811: As per Andrzej's notes on Traffic Light, the above clafer code should desugars to 

a {
  b ? {
    c ? {
      [initially c]
    }
    d ? e ? 
  }
  }

But the result is 

a {
  b ? {
    initial c ? d ? e ? 
  }
  }
