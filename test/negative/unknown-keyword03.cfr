// behavioral clafer test for next or X temporal operator

a
 b ?
  c ?
  [temp next c]


// Rao: 2014-08-04: This should fail as 'next' is a unary operator   
// but it is parsing correctly, which is an error.
// Even if there is a term before 'next', it should be a valid 
// e.g: k => next c (if k is a clafer) or next next c
// May be the same applies to other unary operators such as G, and F.
