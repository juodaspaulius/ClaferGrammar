// Test for negative clafer constraint

a
 xor b ?
  	c ==> 
  	d 
  	e 


/*
Actually this code is supposed to fail. But surprisingly it passed the parser check.
Desugared sytax is 

a {
  xor b ? {
    c ==> d e 
  }
  }

To discuss with Paulius.
This passes the test because it ignores the missing clafer and takes the next clafer.

Of couse the following case fails as expected as there is no follwing clafer.

a
 xor b ?
	d 
  	e  	
	c ==> 
 
So How should we handle this case? To discuss in meeting.
